    <h1>DAVID GIGREMOSA Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

    <h2>First, the basics.</h2>

    <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>HTML and CSS</li>
      <li>Javascript</li>
      <li>Node.js</li>
    </ul>

You should list your top 5 albums below. This is to show you know how to use a list element.

    <ol>
      <li>Luv is Rage 2</li>
      <li>MAP OF THE SOUL: PERSONA</li>
      <li>Beerbongs & Bentleys</li>
      <li>Cosmic</li>
      <li>Igor</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in a line of text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Empty Elements</h3>

    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br />
    Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br />
    Add a hard line under here, and break the previous two lines using a soft line break.
    <hr />

Images 
Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
